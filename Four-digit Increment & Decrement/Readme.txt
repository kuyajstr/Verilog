This verilog files run a simulation of a digital circuit that increment/decrement a four-digit number.


For input, use the four pushbuttons to set the increment/decrement value, specifically:
KEY0: 1,
KEY1: 3,
KEY2: 5,
KEY3: 10.

SW9 set the mode when the circuit increment/decrement the value. Specifically, if
SW9 = 0 (increment),
SW9 = 1 (decrement).
